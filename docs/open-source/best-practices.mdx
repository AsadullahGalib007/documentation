# Best practices for your project

If you have an idea for a Qiskit-based project, you'll often want to share it
with the community. Putting your code online is a good start, but if a user
can't work out how to install or use your project, they'll give up and move on.
This page covers licensing, packaging, testing, and documenting your project,
all of which improve users' experience. If you're releasing research code,
following best practices will also help others reproduce your results.

## Choose a license

If you want others to use your project, you *must* choose an appropriate
license. Otherwise, your grant no permission for others to use it. Most
projects in the [Qiskit ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem) use
the Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses. Visit GitHub's [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) to
decide which license is best for you.

Add your license to the top level of your repository in a text file named
`LICENSE`. When you create a new repository, GitHub will give you the option to
automatically add a standard license.

## Dependency management

If you don't clearly specify your project's dependencies, users (including your
future self) will struggle to install and use it.

The simplest way to list your requirements is to put the Python version you're
using in your `README` and include a
[`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/)
file in your repository. However, this means you must manually identify your
requirements and keep the file in sync.

Tools such as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) solve this problem by
managing dependencies for you, which means they can keep track of everything
you've installed. Installing a dependency through Poetry will add it to a
"lock" file, which keeps track of the exact versions of each package you have
installed. Users can use the lockfile to replicate your environment.

See [Poetry: Basic usage](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) to set
up your project with Poetry.

## Test your project

* Tests ensure your code does a certain thing and should make development easier
  * If the tests pass, your code is good
  * Makes it easy to refactor or add new features

* unittest or pytest
* Setting up pytest w/ simple example

## Code quality tools

* black
* pylint
* mypy

## Package your project

* Makes it easy for users to install
  * Good for adoption and reproducability

* Packaging for PyPI (`pip install ...`)
* Make it easy to release with an action
* Integrating with Qiskit
  * Provider
  * Transpiler plugin

## Security

* Set up 2FA on GitHub
* Make sure your dependences are secure with dependabot
* Set up branch protection
