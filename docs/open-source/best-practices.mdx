# Best practices for your project

* Why you should care
  * Improves user experience
    * Installation
    * Testing for stability
    * Documentation: See dedicated page
  * Makes working with the repo easier
    * Testing == less frustration
    * Linters == neatness
    * Both help others contribute to your project
    * Contributors documentation: See dedicated page
  * Security

## Choose a license

* No license ~= can't use
* Choose from available licenses (link to OSC)
* Explain GPL vs Apache etc.

## Dependency management

* Project will rely on other packages
  * If you don't state this clearly, it's hard to get things working again

* Simple requirements.txt file
* Setting up poetry
* Link: Security with dependabot

## Test your project

* Tests ensure your code does a certain thing and should make development easier
  * If the tests pass, your code is good
  * Makes it easy to refactor or add new features

* unittest or pytest
* Setting up pytest w/ simple example

## Code quality tools

* black
* pylint
* mypy

## Package your project

* Makes it easy for users to install
  * Good for adoption and reproducability

* Packaging for PyPI (`pip install ...`)
* Make it easy to release with an action
* Integrating with Qiskit
  * Provider
  * Transpiler plugin

## Security

* Set up 2FA on GitHub
* Make sure your dependences are secure with dependabot
* Set up branch protection
