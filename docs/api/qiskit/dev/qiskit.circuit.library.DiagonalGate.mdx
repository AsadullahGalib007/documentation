# DiagonalGate

<Class id="qiskit.circuit.library.DiagonalGate" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/1.3/qiskit/circuit/library/generalized_gates/diagonal.py#L55-L149" signature="qiskit.circuit.library.DiagonalGate(diag)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`Gate`](qiskit.circuit.Gate "qiskit.circuit.gate.Gate")

  A generic diagonal quantum gate.

  Matrix form:

$$
\text{DiagonalGate}\ q_0, q_1, .., q_{n-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
D[0]    & 0         & \dots     & 0 \\
0       & D[1]      & \dots     & 0 \\
\vdots  & \vdots    & \ddots    & 0 \\
0       & 0         & \dots     & D[n-1]
\end{pmatrix}


$$

  Diagonal gates are useful as representations of Boolean functions, as they can map from $\{0,1\}^{2^n}$ to $\{0,1\}^{2^n}$ space. For example a phase oracle can be seen as a diagonal gate with $\{1, -1\}$ on the diagonals. Such an oracle will induce a $+1$ or :math\`-1\` phase on the amplitude of any corresponding basis state.

  Diagonal gates appear in many classically hard oracular problems such as Forrelation or Hidden Shift circuits.

  Diagonal gates are represented and simulated more efficiently than a dense $2^n \times 2^n$ unitary matrix.

  The reference implementation is via the method described in Theorem 7 of \[1]. The code is based on Emanuel Malvetti’s semester thesis at ETH in 2018, supervised by Raban Iten and Prof. Renato Renner.

  ## Methods

  ### inverse

  <Function id="qiskit.circuit.library.DiagonalGate.inverse" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/1.3/qiskit/circuit/library/generalized_gates/diagonal.py#L133-L138" signature="inverse(annotated=False)">
    Return the inverse of the diagonal gate.

    **Parameters**

    **annotated** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")) –
  </Function>

  ### validate\_parameter

  <Function id="qiskit.circuit.library.DiagonalGate.validate_parameter" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/1.3/qiskit/circuit/library/generalized_gates/diagonal.py#L125-L131" signature="validate_parameter(parameter)">
    Diagonal Gate parameter should accept complex (in addition to the Gate parameter types) and always return build-in complex.
