# Qiskit addons

Qiskit addons are modular tools for building utility-grade quantum [workflows](/intro-to-patterns) powered by Qiskit. They translate research-verified capabilities into reusable software.


## Mapping tools

### Multiproduct formulas

Reduce the Trotter error of Hamiltonian dynamics through a weighted combination of several circuit executions.

## Optimizing tools

### Operator backpropagation

Reduce circuit depth by trimming operations from the end at the cost of more operator measurements.

### Circuit cutting

Reduce the depth of transpiled circuits by cutting long range gates.

## Postprocessing tools

### Sample-based quantum diagonalization

Classically postprocess noisy quantum samples to yield more accurate energy estimations.

#### Dice solver

Python wrapper for a dice-based eigensolver that can be used as a plugin to `qiskit-addon-sqd` to support larger problem instances.
