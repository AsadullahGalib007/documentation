# Qiskit addons

Qiskit addons are modular tools for building utility-grade quantum [workflows](/intro-to-patterns) powered by Qiskit. They translate research-verified capabilities into reusable software.


## Mapping tools

Multiproduct formulas
- Reduce the Trotter error of Hamiltonian dynamics through a weighted combination of several circuit executions.

- documentation: <insert-link>

## Optimizing tools

Operator backpropagation
- Reduce circuit depth by trimming operations from its end at the cost of more operator measurements.

Circuit cutting
- Reduce the depth of transpiled circuits by cutting long range gates.

## Postprocessing tools

Sample-based quantum diagonalization
- Classically postprocess noisy quantum samples to yield more accurate energy estimations.
- repo: [https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd)

### Dice solver
- Python wrapper for a Dice-based eigensolver that can be used as a plugin to `qiskit-addon-sqd` to support larger problem instances.
