# Qiskit addons

Qiskit addons are a collection of modular tools for building utility-scale workloads powered by Qiskit. These tools are derived from advanced research capabilities and are designed to be stackable with other tools as part of a [Qiskit pattern.](./intro-to-patterns)

## Mapping tools

### Multi-product formulas

Multi-product formulas (MPF) reduce the Trotter error of Hamiltonian dynamics through a weighted combination of several circuit executions.

- Read the [documentation.](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf)

## Optimizing tools

### Operator backpropagation

Operator backpropagation (OBP) reduces circuit depth by trimming operations from the end at the cost of more operator measurements.

- Read the [documentation.](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-obp)

### Circuit cutting

Circuit cutting reduces the depth of transpiled circuits by decomposing long range gates.

## Postprocessing tools

### Sample-based quantum diagonalization

Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) classically postprocesses noisy quantum samples to yield more accurate energy estimations.
